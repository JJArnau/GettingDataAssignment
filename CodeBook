Summary:
This file describes the variables & data used on the week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course assignment, as well as the data transformation performed.

Variables:

(1) x_test, y_test, subject_test, x_train, y_train, subject_train = data from downloaded files.

(2) x_data, y_data, subject_data = dataset that merge previously downloaded files for further analysis.

(3) Full_Data = dataset that merges all final data.

(4) averages = contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, which are later saved into averagesOutputData.txt.

Data Transformations:

(1) rbind to merge similar data.

(2) Extract the columns with mean and std measures. Assign them the "right" names from the features.txt file.

(3) Add also relevant names to the columns in the dataset ("Activity" & "Subject").

(4) Generate a dataset combining the three working ones, which is later used to create the output file averagesOutputdata.txt.
