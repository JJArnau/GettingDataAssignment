# GettingDataAssignment
In this GitHub repository you will find the R code and documentation for the final assignment of "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course.

Files Available:

(1) run_analysis.R: code to do the five steps described as part of the assignment. The code itself downloads the .zip files, unzip it, and works through the different steps, creating a final output file named "averagesOutputData.txt".

(2) averagesOutputData.txt: output data of the step # 5 of the assignment.

(3) CodeBook.md: provides details of the variables, data and their transformations. 

Assignment details:

Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

(1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

(2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

(3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

(4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

(5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
